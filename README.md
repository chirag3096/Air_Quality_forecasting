BUSINESS PROBLEM :
- Carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions are the primary driver of global climate change. It is widely recognized that to avoid the worst impacts of climate change, the world needs to urgently 
  reduce emissions.
- Many industrial processes emit CO2 through fossil fuel consumption. Several processes also produce CO2 emissions through chemical reactions that do not involve combustion. Many 
  industrial processes also use electricity and therefore indirectly result in CO2 emissions from electricity generation.
- CO2 is constantly being exchanged among the atmosphere, ocean, and land surface as it is both produced and absorbed by many microorganisms, plants, and animals. Since the Industrial 
  Revolution began around 1750, human activities have contributed substantially to climate change by adding CO2 and other heat-trapping gases to the atmosphere.

BUSINESS  OBJECTIVE : 
- To forecast Co2 levels for an organization so that the organization can follow government norms with respect to Co2 emission levels.
